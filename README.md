## 🧰 Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Docker**  
  Required for containerized deployment.
  
- **MySQL Client**  
  Required to create the database during setup.

---

## 🚀 Quick Installation

Run the official installation script to deploy a new instance:

```bash
curl -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D-Best-App/Timesmart/main/Install/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
sudo ./install.sh
```

### 🧩 What the script does:

- Prompts for **Company Name**, which sets the container/database name.
- Asks for **Database Host, User, and Password**.
- Downloads `docker-compose.yml` and SQL schema from GitHub.
- Creates the Docker container from the image: `dbest25/timesmart:latest`
- Initializes a new MySQL database (if requested).

---

## 🌐 Accessing the App

After installation, determine the container’s IP (if not using port mapping):

```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' Timeclock-<YourCompanyName>
```

Replace `<YourCompanyName>` with your actual name used during setup.

Then open in your browser:

```
http://<container_ip>
```

## 👨‍💼 Admin Access

- URL: `http://<container_ip>/admin/login.php`
- **Default Credentials:**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `password`

You should change this password immediately after first login.

---

## 👷 Employee Access

- URL: `http://<container_ip>/user/login.php`
- Credentials must be created by the administrator.
