## 🧰 Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Docker** (version 20.10+)  
  Required for containerized deployment.
  
- **MySQL/MariaDB Server**  
  External database server (can be Docker or dedicated server).
  
- **MySQL Client** (optional)  
  For automatic database creation during installation.

- **Git**  
  Required to clone the repository.

---

## 🚀 Quick Installation

Run the official installation script to deploy a new instance:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D-Best-App/Timesmart/main/deploy/scripts/install.sh)
```

### 🧩 What the script does:

- Checks prerequisites (Docker, Git, MySQL client)
- Prompts for **Company Name** (sets container/database name)
- Asks for **Database Host, User, and Password**
- Clones full repository to `Timeclock-<CompanyName>`
- Configures `docker-compose.yml` with your settings
- Creates MySQL database and imports schema (optional)
- Starts Docker container with volume mounts
- Shows container IP and access information

**Installation takes ~2 minutes.**

See [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for detailed installation instructions.

---

## 🌐 Accessing the App

After installation, the script displays the container IP address:

```bash
Container IP: 172.17.0.5
Access URL: http://172.17.0.5
```

Open in your browser:

```
http://<container_ip>
```

For permanent access, configure a reverse proxy (Nginx/Traefik) or use Cloudflare tunnel.

---

## 👨‍💼 Admin Access

- **URL**: `http://<container_ip>/admin/`
- **Default Credentials:**
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `password`

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Change the default password immediately after first login!

It's highly recommended to enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for all admin accounts.

---

## 👷 Employee Access

- **URL**: `http://<container_ip>/user/`
- Employee credentials must be created by an administrator
- Access via: Admin Panel → Manage Users → Add User

## 🛡️ Backup & Restore

### Automated Backups

Configure the included backup script:

```bash
# Edit with your database credentials
sudo nano deploy/scripts/backup.sh

# Test backup
sudo ./deploy/scripts/backup.sh

# Schedule via cron (hourly)
crontab -e
# Add: 0 * * * * /opt/Timeclock-YourCompany/deploy/scripts/backup.sh
```

Backups are stored in `/var/sql-data/<company>/` with:
- Hourly backups (last 8 kept)
- Daily backups at 8 PM

### Manual Backup

```bash
mysqldump -h 172.17.0.1 -u timeclock -p timeclock-yourcompany | gzip > backup.sql.gz
```

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for restore procedures.

## 🔧 Development

TimeSmart uses **volume mounts** for easy development:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/D-Best-App/Timesmart.git
cd Timesmart

# Configure docker-compose.yml

# Start container
docker compose up -d

# Edit files in app/ directory
nano app/admin/dashboard.php

# Changes appear immediately in browser!
# No rebuilds, no docker cp, no hassle.
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for developer documentation.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `docker: command not found` | Install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ |
| `git: command not found` | Install Git: `sudo apt-get install git` |
| Database connection fails | Verify DB credentials in `docker-compose.yml` |
| Container not starting | Check logs: `docker logs Timeclock-<CompanyName>` |
| Changes not appearing | With volume mounts, changes are instant. Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) |
| Container IP not responding | Verify container is running: `docker ps` |
